# Algorithmic-thinking
One thing is that given code in course is Python2 and I used Python3 which I think is a little different but don't need to change too much.
This records the codes for Algorithmic thinking course from Rice University on Coursera. Hope this would stimulate myself to finish this course and continue learning new things!
